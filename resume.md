## Projects

### Research on Nap Patterns
- Conducted research as part of the CATSLEEP research program to investigate the factors influencing nap patterns in cats.
- Analyzed a longitudinal dataset of 10,000 cats across various breeds to compare nap preferences and durations across different groups.
- Used statistical methods and machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and trends in the data, and conducted purr hypothesis testing to validate findings.

### Yarn Toy Predictive Modeling
- Participated in a Meow-sponsored Kaggle competition on Yarn Toy Predictive Modeling, with a goal to forecast next month's popular yarn toys.
- Utilized CatBoost techniques, including meowboost, purrboost, and hissboost, as part of a powerful VotingClassifier ensemble model.
- Conducted thorough preliminary data analysis of every yarn type in the dataset, using scratching posts and catnip vectors to ensure the highest possible accuracy.
- Employed sophisticated feature engineering to optimize the performance of the model, leading to a nearly 5x improvement in predicting the next favorite yarn toy.

### Bird-watching Behavior Analysis
- Leveraged datasets on bird sightings and chirping patterns from Jan 2018 to Oct 2020 to predict cat behavior during bird-watching sessions.
- Achieved a winning Purrformance Score of 0.52 using DecisionTreeRegressor, surpassing other popular models like Random Bird Forest and XGMeow.
- Experimented with state-of-the-art models like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and external datasets.
- Applied feature engineering techniques such as smoothing chirping patterns and utilizing lag variables to optimize model performance.
- Demonstrated a deep understanding of feature selection, whisker tuning, and cross-validation techniques to create a reliable and robust prediction model.
