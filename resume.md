## Projects

### Research on Tenure-Track Women Professors
- Conducted research as part of the YOU'RE@CU research program to investigate beliefs about why tenure-track women professors leave the tenure track.
- Analyzed a longitudinal dataset of 10,000 tenure-track professors across various demographics to compare accuracy of beliefs on the subject across different groups.
- Used statistical methods and machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and trends in the data, and conducted hypothesis testing to validate findings.

### GoDaddy Microbusiness Density Forecasting
- Participated in a GoDaddy-sponsored Kaggle competition on Microbusiness Density Forecasting, with a goal to forecast next month's microbusiness density.
- Utilized Gradient Boosting techniques, including lightgbm, xgboost, and catboost, as part of a powerful VotingRegressor ensemble model.
- Conducted thorough preliminary data analysis of every county in the dataset, using blacklists and bias vectors to ensure the highest possible accuracy.
- Employed sophisticated feature engineering to optimize the performance of the model, leading to a nearly 5x improvement in model performance.

### Weather-based Traffic Prediction
- Leveraged datasets on traffic history and weather patterns from Jan 2018 to Oct 2020 to predict traffic conditions at various locations over the same time period in a Kaggle competition.
- Achieved a winning Macro F1-Score of 0.52 using DecisionTreeRegressor, surpassing other popular models like Random Forest and XGBoost.
- Experimented with state-of-the-art models like RNNs and external datasets.
- Applied feature engineering techniques such as smoothing weather patterns and utilizing lag variables to optimize model performance.
- Demonstrated a deep understanding of feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, and cross-validation techniques to create a reliable and robust prediction model.
